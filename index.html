            To wrap up January, we are proud to bring you the release of Firefox
            85. In this version we are bringing you support for the
            :focus-visible pseudo-class in CSS and associated devtools, and the
            complete removal of Flash support from Firefox.

        <h2>Top 3 Jobs</h2>
        <p>
          The release of Apple Silicon-based Macs at the end of last year
          generated a flurry of news coverage and some surprises at the
          machine’s performance. This post details some background information
          on the experience of porting Firefox to run natively on these CPUs.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll start with some background on the Mac transition and give an
          overview of Firefox internals that needed to know about the new
          architecture, before moving on to the concept of Universal Binaries.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll then explain how DRM/EME works on the new platform, talk about
          our experience with macOS Big Sur, and discuss various updater
          problems we had to deal with. We’ll conclude with the release and an
          overview of various other improvements that are in the pipeline.
